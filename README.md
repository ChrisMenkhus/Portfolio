# Portfolio

My portfolio of projects made with **Nextjs**. This website was made to show off my portfolio of web development work. In the future i'd like to create a new portfolio with a modern design. The data for this project is provided by a headless CMS called **Prismic** so updating the app with new projects is easy and doesn't require fetching from an API.

### How to navigate this project

The styling of this project is handled by **styled-components** so the styles are nestled in with the code for that component. These are located in Portfolio/Components.

The Nextjs project is rendering pages from Portfolio/pages through the App.js file. These 'pages' or react components each have the code to make that page possible. The Projects.js file contains the functions used to render the list of projects.

### Dependencies

- Next
- Prismic-Javascript
- React
- React-Ionicons
- Styled Components

### What I would do differently

I would make the website stand out more by adding different animations and a bolder design, for example the description of each project would be more informative if it pulled the markdown file from github and displayed that instead.
